Frontend Developer Portfolio Assignment
This project is a pixel-perfect implementation of a Frontend Developer Portfolio based on a provided Figma design. The assignment was completed as part of the Josh Technology Group (JTG) hiring process.

🚀 Project Overview
The goal of this assignment was to build a static, high-fidelity landing page using semantic HTML5, clean CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript. The project emphasizes pixel perfection and industry-standard coding practices.


🛠️ Tech Stack

HTML5: Used semantic tags like <section>, <header>, <footer>, and <article> for better accessibility and SEO.


CSS3: Custom styling without any frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind.




JavaScript: Vanilla JS/jQuery used for interactive elements like the modal and slider.



Google Fonts: Integrated 'Open Sans' as the primary typeface.

✨ Key Features

Pixel-Perfect Design: The layout matches the Figma mockup exactly, ensuring high visual fidelity.



Interactive Carousel: A working slider implemented to navigate through content, sliding one item at a time.


Custom Modal: A fully functional "Hire Me" modal built from scratch without external UI libraries.


Cross-Browser Compatibility: Tested and optimized for Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.


Fluid Layout: The webpage is responsive for desktop viewports, consuming 100% width as needed without horizontal scrolling.

📋 Assignment Guidelines Followed

No Frameworks: Strictly avoided CSS (Bootstrap, Material UI) or JS (React, Angular) frameworks.



Semantic Structure: Utilized <div> elements and semantic tags for layout instead of tables.



Best Practices: Followed clean code, optimization, and maintainable project structure.
